- Define what naming conventions are and their importance in coding.
- Discuss common conventions like camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case, and kebab-case.

# Naming Conventions:

there are mainly 4 types of naming conventions in industry:

- Camel Case.
- Snake Case.
- Kebab Case.
- Pascal Case.

## Camel Case:

In camel case, you start a name with a small letter. If the name has multiple words, the later words will start with a capital letter:
ex: `userName, userPassword`

## Snake Case:

Like in camel case, you start the name with a small letter in snake case. If the name has multiple words, the later words will start with small letters and you use a underscore (\_) to separate the words.
ex: `user_name, user_password`

## Kebab Case:

Kebab case is similar to snake case, but you use a hyphen (-) instead of an underscore (\_) to separate the words.
ex: `user-name, user-password`

## Pascal Case:

pascal case start with a capital letter. In case of the names with multiple words, all words will start with capital letters.
ex: `UserName, UserPassword`

# Discussion:

Naming conventions in programming provide guidelines for developers to select clear and consistent names for variables, functions, classes, and other code elements. These conventions enhance readability and maintainability by ensuring that names are descriptive and intuitive. Adhering to naming standards helps minimize errors, making code easier to understand. This consistency not only aids individual developers but also promotes smoother collaboration within teams, as everyone can quickly grasp the purpose of each component. By following established naming conventions, developers create more organized and accessible codebases, ultimately leading to improved productivity and reduced maintenance challenges.
